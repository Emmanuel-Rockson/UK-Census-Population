# UK-Census-Population Project
Data analysis project using Python and a simulated UK census dataset to recommend land development and government investment priorities through demographic insights and data-driven decision-making.

# Examining the Census Population Data: Land Development and Investment Recommendations

# Project Overview
This project analyzes a simulated UK census dataset to make data-driven recommendations on land development and government investment priorities for a small town.
The dataset — generated with Python’s Faker package — mirrors the structure of the 1881 UK Census but represents modern demographic characteristics.

Through extensive data cleaning, demographic analysis, and visualization, the project identifies trends in age distribution, religion, and occupation to support evidence-based urban planning.

# Project Objectives

* Clean and preprocess census-style demographic data.
* Explore population composition by age, religion, and occupation.
* Estimate birth and death rates, and calculate population growth.
* Recommend suitable land development options and government investment priorities.

# About the dataset
File: T1_A24census4.csv
Source: Simulated dataset created using Python Faker package

# Notebook Overview
* Data wrangling/Data cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualisation
* Demographic Modelling

# Key Findings

* The population is young and economically active, dominated by working-age individuals.
* There is a balanced gender structure, with a slightly higher female life expectancy.
* A gradual increase in elderly residents suggests future demand for elderly care services.
* Commuting population is small, so major transport investments (e.g., train stations) are not cost-effective.
* The town has strong Christian representation, reducing the need for additional religious infrastructure.
